Instruction: 

To run the code just run the file index.html
This file is able to run without the leap motion controller connected to your computer.

Best quality images included only to safe space.
More images can be found on my github of the different level of qualities I tested.

Leap motion instructions: 

Connect the leap motion controller through a USB port, make sure to be able to see the control panel

From the leap motion application website: https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/javascript/supplements/Leap_Application.html

Unplugged-Icon (black) — the Leap Motion controller is unplugged (or the Leap Motion software hasn’t 
detected it yet).

Normal-Icon(green) — the Leap Motion controller and software are operating normally.

Smudge-Icon (orange)— indicates that a smudge or other contamination might be clouding 
the Leap Motion Controller sensor window.

ForcePause (red)-Icon — indicates that tracking has been suspended because the Leap 
Motion frame rate is below the acceptable threshold. USB bandwidth contention is the 
primary correctable cause of poor performance and can often be resolved by plugging 
the Leap Motion controller into a different USB port, plugging the controller directly 
into the computer rather than using USB hubs or extender cables, or removing other USB devices.

FPSLow-Icon (yellow) — indicates that the Leap Motion frame rate is below the acceptable 
threshold and you have turned off the Avoid Poor Performance option in the Leap Motion
Control Panel. Tracking continues with greatly reduced reliability.

Updates-Icon (green with a purple arrow)— indicates that an update is available for 
the Leap Motion software. Open the Leap Motion Control Panel to install the update.

Once connected and running correction run the index.html file 
The hand should be recognised and the leap motion should be reading all the gestures.

Gestures are:

Zoom in out, 4 or 5 fingers and moving the hands up and down (closer or further away from the controller)

Rotate, with 2 or 3 fingers you move your hand left, right, up or down in the direction you want to rotate it.
